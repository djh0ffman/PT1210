********************************************************************
* font specification and inquiry tags
*
*! tags flagged with an exclaimation mark are valid for
*    specification.
*  ? tags flagged with a question mark are valid for inquiry
*
* fixed binary numbers are encoded as 16 bits of integer and
* 16 bits of fraction.	Negative values are indicated by twos
* complement of all 32 bits.


*! OT_DeviceDPI specifies the target device dots per inch -- X DPI is
*    in the high word, Y DPI in the low word.  OT_DeviceDPI == TA_DeviceDPI.
OT_DeviceDPI	EQU	(OT_Level0!$01)

*! OT_DotSize specifies the target device dot size as a percent of
*    it's resolution-implied size -- X percent in high word, Y percent
*    in low word.
OT_DotSize	EQU	(OT_Level0!$02)

*! OT_PointHeight specifies the requested point height of a typeface,
*    specifically, the height and nominal width of the em-square.
*    The point referred to here is 1/72".  It is encoded as a fixed
*    binary number.
OT_PointHeight	EQU	(OT_Level0!$08)

*! OT_SetFactor specifies the requested set width of a typeface.
*    It distorts the width of the em-square from that specified by
*    OT_PointHeight.  To compensate for a device with different
*    horizontal and vertical resolutions, OT_DeviceDPI should be used
*    instead.  For a normal aspect ratio, set to 1.0 (encoded as
*    0x00010000).  This is the default value.
OT_SetFactor	EQU	(OT_Level0!$09)

*! OT_Shear... specifies the Sine and Cosine of the vertical stroke
*    angle, as two fixed point binary fractions.  Both must be specified:
*    first the Sine and then the Cosine.  Setting the sine component
*    changes the Shear to an undefined value, setting the cosine
*    component completes the Shear change to the new composite value.
*    For no shear, set to 0.0, 1.0 (encoded as 0x00000000, 0x00010000).
*    This is the default value.
OT_ShearSin	EQU	(OT_Level0!$0a)
OT_ShearCos	EQU	(OT_Level0!$0b)

*! OT_Rotate... specifies the Sine and Cosine of the baselin rotation
*    angle, as two fixed point binary fractions.  Both must be specified:
*    first the Sine and then the Cosine.  Setting the sine component
*    changes the Shear to an undefined value, setting the cosine
*    component completes the Shear change to the new composite value.
*    For no shear, set to 0.0, 1.0 (encoded as 0x00000000, 0x00010000).
*    This is the default value.
OT_RotateSin	EQU	(OT_Level0!$0c)
OT_RotateCos	EQU	(OT_Level0!$0d)

*! OT_Embolden... specifies values to algorithimically embolden -- or,
*    when negative, lighten -- the glyph.  It is encoded as a fixed point
*    binary fraction of the em-square.  The X and Y components can be
*    changed indendently.  For normal characters, set to 0.0, 0.0
*    (encoded as 0x00000000, 0x00000000).  This is the default value.
OT_EmboldenX	EQU	(OT_Level0!$0e)
OT_EmboldenY	EQU	(OT_Level0!$0f)

*! OT_PointSize is an old method of specifying the point size,
*    encoded as (points * 16).
OT_PointSize	EQU	(OT_Level0!$10)

*! OT_GlyphCode specifies the glyph (character) code to use with
*    subsequent operations.  For example, this is the code for an
*    OT_Glyph inquiry
OT_GlyphCode	EQU	(OT_Level0!$11)

*! OT_GlyphCode2 specifies the second glyph code.  For example,
*    this is the right glyph of the two glyphs of an OT_KernPair
*    inquiry
OT_GlyphCode2	EQU	(OT_Level0!$12)

*! OT_GlyphWidth specifies a specific width for a glyph.
*    It sets a specific escapement (advance) width for subsequent
*    glyphs.  It is encoded as a fixed binary fraction of the em-square.
*    To revert to using the font-defined escapement for each glyph, set
*    to 0.0 (encoded as 0x00000000).  This is the default value.
OT_GlyphWidth	EQU	(OT_Level0!$13)

*! OT_OTagPath and
*! OT_OTagList specify the selected typeface.  Both must be specified:
*    first the Path and then the List.  Setting the path name changes
*    changes the typeface to an undefined value, providing the List
*    completes the typeface selection to the new typeface.  OTagPath
*    is the null terminated full file path of the .otag file associated
*    with the typeface.  OTagList is a memory copy of the processed
*    contents of that .otag file (i.e. with indirections resolved).
*    There are no default values for the typeface.
OT_OTagPath	EQU	(OT_Level0!OT_Indirect!$14)
OT_OTagList	EQU	(OT_Level0!OT_Indirect!$15)

*  ? OT_GlyphMap supplies a read-only struct GlyphMap pointer that
*    describes a bitmap for a glyph with the current attributes.
OT_GlyphMap	EQU	(OT_Level0!OT_Indirect!$20)

*  ? OT_WidthList supplies a read-only struct MinList of struct
*    GlyphWidthEntry nodes for glyphs that are defined from GlyphCode
*    to GlyphCode2, inclusive.  The widths are represented as fixed
*    binary fractions of the em-square, ignoring any effect of
*    SetFactor or GlyphWidth.  A width would need to be converted to
*    a distance along the baseline in device units by the
*    application.
OT_WidthList	EQU	(OT_Level0!OT_Indirect!$21)

*  ? OT_...KernPair supplies the kern adjustment to be added to the
*    current position after placement of the GlyphCode glyph and
*    before placement of the GlyphCode2 glyph.  Text kern pairs are
*    for rendering body text.  Display kern pairs are generally
*    tighter values for display (e.g. headline) purposes.  The
*    adjustment is represented as a fixed binary fraction of the
*    em-square, ignoring any effect of SetFactor.  This number would
*    need to be converted to a distance along the baseline in device
*    units by the application.
OT_TextKernPair		EQU	(OT_Level0!OT_Indirect!$22)
OT_DesignKernPair	EQU	(OT_Level0!OT_Indirect!$23)

*  ? OT_Underlined is an unsigned word which is used to request
*    algorithimic underlining for the engine when rendering the glyph.
*    Bullet.library currently does not support this tag, though it
*    may be used by other engines in the future.  The default for
*    any engine which supports this tag must be OTUL_None.  Engines which
*    do not support this tag should return an appropriate OTERR value.
*
*    As of V39, diskfont.library will request underlining if specified
*    in the TextAttr, or TTextAttr passed to OpenDiskFont().  Diskfont
*    will first request Broken underlining (like the Text() function
*    does when SetSoftStyle() is used), and then Solid underlining if
*    the engine returns an error.  If the engine returns an error for
*    both, then diskfont.library attempts to find, or create the best
*    non-underlined font that it can.
OT_UnderLined		EQU	(OT_Level0!$24)

OTUL_None		EQU	0
OTUL_Solid		EQU	1
OTUL_Broken		EQU	2
OTUL_DoubleSolid	EQU	3
OUTL_DoubleBroken	EQU	4

*  ? OT_StrikeThrough is a boolean which is used to request
*    algorithimic strike through when rendering the glyph.
*    Bullet.library currently does not support this tag, though it
*    may be used by other engines in the future.  The default for
*    any engined which supports this tag must be FALSE.  Engines which
*    do not support this tag should return an appropriate OTERR value.
OT_StrikeThrough	EQU	(OT_Level0!$25)
