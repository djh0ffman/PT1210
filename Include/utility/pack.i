* PackTable definition:
*
* The PackTable is a simple array of LONGWORDS that are then evaluated
* by PackStructureTags and UnpackStructureTags.
*
* The table contains compressed information such as the tag offset from
* the base tag.  The tag offset has a limited range so the base tag is
* defined in the first longword.
*
* After the first longword, the fields look as follows:
*
*	+--------- 1 = signed, 0 = unsigned (for bits, 1=inverted boolean)
*	|
*	|  +------ 00 = Pack/Unpack, 10 = Pack, 01 = Unpack, 11 = special
*	| / \
*	| | |  +-- 00 = Byte, 01 = Word, 10 = Long, 11 = Bit
*	| | | / \
*	| | | | | /----- For bit operations: 1 = TAG_EXISTS is TRUE
*	| | | | | |
*	| | | | | | /-------------------- Tag offset from base tag value
*	| | | | | | |		      \
*	m n n o o p q q q q q q q q q q r r r s s s s s s s s s s s s s
*					\   | |		      |
*	Bit offset (for bit operations) ----/ |		      |
*					      \ 		      |
*	Offset into data structure -----------------------------------/
*
* A -1 longword signifies that the next longword will be a new base tag
*
* A 0 longword signifies that it is the end of the pack table.
*
* What this implies is that there are only 13-bits of address offset
* and 10 bits for tag offsets from the base tag.  For most uses this
* should be enough, but when this is not, either multiple pack tables
* or a pack table with extra base tags would be able to do the trick.
* The goal here was to make the tables small and yet flexible enough to
* handle most cases.
