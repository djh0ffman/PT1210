; === DrawInfo =========================================================
; ========================================================================

* This is a packet of information for graphics rendering.  It originates
* with a Screen, and is gotten using GetScreenDrawInfo( screen );

* You can use the Intuition version number to tell which fields are
* present in this structure.
*
* DRI_VERSION of 1 corresponds to V37 release.
* DRI_VERSION of 2 corresponds to V39, and includes three new pens
*	and the dri_CheckMark and dri_AmigaKey fields.
*
* Note that sometimes applications need to create their own DrawInfo
* structures, in which case the DRI_VERSION won't correspond exactly
* to the OS version!!!

DRI_VERSION	EQU	2

    EITEM	NUMDRIPENS

* New for V39:  It is sometimes useful to specify that a pen value
* is to be the complement of color zero to three.  The "magic" numbers
* serve that purpose:

PEN_C3		EQU	$FEFC		; Complement of color 3
PEN_C2		EQU	$FEFD		; Complement of color 2
PEN_C1		EQU	$FEFE		; Complement of color 1
PEN_C0		EQU	$FEFF		; Complement of color 0

* VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT Screen->BitMap.  In the future, bitmaps
* will need to grow.  The embedded instance of a bitmap in the screen
* will no longer be large enough to hold the whole description of
* the bitmap.
*
* YOU ARE STRONGLY URGED to use Screen->RastPort.BitMap in place of
* &Screen->BitMap whenever and whereever possible.

    EITEM SA_ColorMapEntries ; New for V39:
			; Allows you to override the number of entries
			; in the ColorMap for your screen.  Intuition

    EITEM SA_VideoControl	; New for V39:
			; ti_Data is a pointer to a taglist that Intuition
			; will pass to graphics.library/VideoControl(),
			; upon opening the screen.

    EITEM SA_FrontChild	; New for V39:
			; ti_Data is a pointer to an already open screen
			; that is to be the child of the screen being
			; opened.  The child screen will be moved to the

    EITEM SA_BackChild	; New for V39:
			; ti_Data is a pointer to an already open screen
			; that is to be the child of the screen being

    EITEM SA_LikeWorkbench ; New for V39:
			 ; Set ti_Data to 1 to request a screen which
			 ; is just like the Workbench.	This gives
			 ; you the same screen mode, depth, size,

* New for V39:	Intuition has new screen depth-arrangement and movement
* functions called ScreenDepth() and ScreenPosition() respectively.
* These functions permit the old behavior of ScreenToFront(),
* ScreenToBack(), and MoveScreen().  ScreenDepth() also allows
* independent depth control of attached screens.  ScreenPosition()
* optionally allows positioning screens even though they were opened
* {SA_Draggable,FALSE}.

* For ScreenDepth(), specify one of SDEPTH_TOFRONT or SDEPTH_TOBACK,
* and optionally also SDEPTH_INFAMILY.
*
* NOTE: ONLY THE OWNER OF THE SCREEN should ever specify
* SDEPTH_INFAMILY.  Commodities, "input helper" programs,
* or any other program that did not open a screen should never
* use that flag.  (Note that this is a style-behavior
* requirement;	there is no technical requirement that the

* the screen).

SDEPTH_CHILDONLY	EQU	SDEPTH_INFAMILY


* For ScreenPosition(), specify one of SPOS_RELATIVE, SPOS_ABSOLUTE,
* or SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE to describe the kind of screen positioning you
* wish to perform:
*
* SPOS_RELATIVE: The x1 and y1 parameters to ScreenPosition() describe
*	the offset in coordinates you wish to move the screen by.
* SPOS_ABSOLUTE: The x1 and y1 parameters to ScreenPosition() describe
*	the absolute coordinates you wish to move the screen to.
* SPOS_MAKEVISIBLE: (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) describes a rectangle on the
*	screen which you would like autoscrolled into view.
* 
* You may additionally set SPOS_FORCEDRAG along with any of the
* above.  Set this if you wish to reposition an {SA_Draggable,FALSE}
* screen that you opened.
*
* NOTE: ONLY THE OWNER OF THE SCREEN should ever specify
* SPOS_FORCEDRAG.  Commodities, "input helper" programs,
* or any other program that did not open a screen should never 
* use that flag.

SPOS_RELATIVE		EQU	0	; Coordinates are relative

* New for V39: Intuition supports double-buffering in screens,
* with friendly interaction with menus and certain gadgets.
* For each buffer, you need to get one of these structures
* from the AllocScreenBuffer() call.  Never allocate your
* own ScreenBuffer structures!
