* NOTE: V37 dos.library, when doing ExAll() emulation, and V37 filesystems
* will return an error if passed ED_OWNER.  If you get ERROR_BAD_NUMBER,
* retry with ED_COMMENT to get everything but owner info.  All filesystems
* supporting ExAll() must support through ED_COMMENT, and must check Type
* and return ERROR_BAD_NUMBER if they don't support the type.

* values that can be passed for what data you want from ExAll()
* each higher value includes those below it (numerically)
* you MUST chose one of these values

ED_NAME		EQU	1
ED_TYPE		EQU	2
ED_SIZE		EQU	3
ED_PROTECTION	EQU	4
ED_DATE		EQU	5
ED_COMMENT	EQU	6

*   Control structure passed to ExAll.  Unused fields MUST be initialized to
*   0, expecially eac_LastKey.
*
*   eac_MatchFunc is a hook (see utility.library documentation for usage)
*   It should return true if the entry is to returned, false if it is to be
*   ignored.
*
*   This structure MUST be allocated by AllocDosObject()!
