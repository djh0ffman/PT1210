* Be sure to protect yourself against someone modifying these data as
* you look at them.  This is done by calling:
*
* lock = LockIBase(0), which returns a ULONG.  When done call
*  D0		  D0
* UnlockIBase(lock) where lock is what LockIBase() returned.
*	       A0
* NOTE: these library functions are simply stubs now, but should be called
* to be compatible with future releases.
